            category: "Ecosystem Assembly",
            difficulty: "Intermediate",
            explanation: "The regional species pool consists of all species that could potentially colonize a habitat based on evolutionary history and biogeographic processes. This pool is then filtered by environmental and biotic factors.",

            category: "Energy Flow",
            difficulty: "Intermediate", 
            explanation: "Energy transfer follows the 10% rule: Primary producers (10,000) to Primary consumers (1,000) to Secondary consumers (100) to Tertiary consumers (10 kcal/m²/year). Each trophic level receives approximately 10% of the energy from the level below.",

            category: "Ecosystem Services",
            difficulty: "Basic",
            explanation: "Provisioning services are tangible products obtained from ecosystems, including food, fresh water, timber, fiber, and genetic resources. Timber from forests is a direct material benefit.",

            category: "Global Threats",
            difficulty: "Intermediate",
            explanation: "Biodiversity loss (measured as extinction rate) has exceeded safe planetary boundaries by 10-100 times the background rate. While other boundaries are stressed, biodiversity loss is in the high risk zone.",

        },
        {
            question: "According to the ecosystem assembly theory, which filter acts FIRST in determining community composition?",

            correctAnswerIndex: 2,
            category: "Ecosystem Assembly",
            difficulty: "Advanced",
            explanation: "Ecosystem assembly follows a hierarchical filtering process: First, the regional species pool determines what species are available through evolutionary and biogeographic history. Then environmental filters select species with appropriate tolerances, followed by biotic filters.",
            reference: "HilleRisLambers et al. (2012) - Rethinking community assembly"
        },
        {
            question: "What percentage of global economic activity (GDP) is estimated to depend directly on nature and ecosystem services?",

            category: "Economic Valuation",
            difficulty: "Basic",
            explanation: "Recent IPBES assessments estimate that 58 trillion dollars of global economic activity (more than half of global GDP) depends directly on nature and ecosystem services, highlighting the critical economic importance of biodiversity conservation.",
            reference: "IPBES (2024) Global Assessment Report"
        },

            category: "Biome Characteristics",
            difficulty: "Basic",
            explanation: "Mediterranean climates are defined by wet, mild winters and hot, dry summers. This seasonal precipitation pattern creates unique evolutionary pressures leading to distinctive adaptations like sclerophylly and fire tolerance.",
            reference: "Blondel et al. (2010) - The Mediterranean Region"
        },
        {

            correctAnswerIndex: 2,
            category: "Biodiversity-Function",
            difficulty: "Intermediate",
            explanation: "The insurance hypothesis suggests that higher biodiversity generally increases ecosystem resilience and stability by providing functional redundancy and complementarity. However, the relationship can be complex and context-dependent.",
            reference: "Tilman et al. (2014) - Biodiversity and ecosystem functioning"
        },
        {
            question: "What is the primary mechanism by which nitrogen becomes available to most plants in terrestrial ecosystems?",

            correctAnswerIndex: 1,
            category: "Biogeochemical Cycles",
            difficulty: "Intermediate",
            explanation: "Although nitrogen gas makes up 78% of the atmosphere, most plants cannot use it directly. Biological nitrogen fixation by specialized bacteria converts atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, making it available to plants.",
