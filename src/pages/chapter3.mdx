## 3.1 Tunisia's Biogeographic Setting

Tunisia occupies a unique position at the intersection of Mediterranean and Saharan biogeographic regions, creating exceptional ecosystem diversity within its **163,610 km² territory**. The country encompasses dramatic environmental gradients, supporting ecosystems ranging from humid cork oak forests in the north to hyperarid desert systems in the south.

### Geographic and Climatic Context
Tunisia's varied topography, from the Northern Mountains of the Tell Atlas to the Southern Desert's salt lakes (chotts), fundamentally shapes ecosystem distribution. This compressed landscape gives rise to distinct bioclimatic zones.

This gradient, spanning just 700 kilometers, creates exceptional **beta diversity** (the change in species composition across environmental gradients) and numerous **ecotones** where species from different biogeographic origins meet.

## 3.2 Forest Ecosystems: Biodiversity Refugia Under Pressure

Covering **970,000 hectares (6.5% of national territory)**, Tunisia's forests serve as critical biodiversity refugia. They represent the southern and eastern limits of many Mediterranean forest types, making them vital for studying ecosystem responses to climate stress.

<summary>Cork Oak Forests (Quercus suber)</summary>
<div class="content">
<p>
Spanning 90,000 hectares in the northwest, these forests require high rainfall (700-1200mm) and acidic soils. They support a rich community, including the endemic Barbary deer, but face threats from a 1.4°C temperature increase and regeneration failure due to grazing pressure.

<p>
The largest forest type (457,000 ha), dominated by the drought-tolerant and fire-adapted Aleppo Pine (_Pinus halepensis_). Specialized coastal forests of Maritime and Stone Pine are critical for dune stabilization and provide valuable products like pine nuts.

## 3.3 Wetland Ecosystems: Biodiversity Hotspots at Risk

Despite covering only **5.5% of Tunisia**, wetlands support disproportionate biodiversity, with 42 sites designated as internationally important under the Ramsar Convention.

<KeyConceptBox title="Case Study: Lake Ichkeul">
<p>
A UNESCO World Heritage site, Ichkeul is a globally significant wetland. It features a unique seasonal cycle, transitioning from a freshwater lake in winter (supporting 200,000+ waterbirds) to a brackish system in summer. After being listed as "in Danger" due to upstream dam construction, a successful restoration program based on managed water releases has made it a model for wetland conservation.

Other key wetlands include coastal lagoons like Bizerte and Ghar El Melh, and traditional, human-created oases that are masterpieces of agro-biodiversity. These oases utilize a three-tier architecture (date palms, fruit trees, ground crops) and sophisticated irrigation systems to create productive microclimates in the desert.

## 3.4 Steppe and Grassland Ecosystems

Central Tunisia's steppes cover **4.5 million hectares**, bridging the Mediterranean and Saharan zones. These ecosystems are dominated by Alfa Grass (_Stipa tenacissima_) and Artemisia, and have co-evolved with traditional pastoral systems like the ancient **Gdel practice**, a community-based system of rangeland resting. Today, these systems are under pressure from overgrazing, with livestock numbers exceeding sustainable capacity by 2-3 times.

## 3.5 Marine and Coastal Ecosystems

Tunisia's **1,445 km coastline** hosts diverse marine habitats. Sandy beaches and dunes are common, but face erosion rates of 70cm per year. Rocky shores support high biodiversity, including over 200 algae species. The most significant marine habitat is the **400,000 hectares of Posidonia oceanica (seagrass) meadows**, which act as critical nursery habitats, stabilize sediments, and store 11-17 million tons of carbon.

The **Gulf of Gabès** is particularly unique, featuring the highest tidal range in the Mediterranean (2.3m). This high productivity zone supports over **300 fish species (30% of the Mediterranean total)** but faces severe threats from overfishing and industrial pollution.

## 3.6 Ecosystem Connectivity and Landscape Ecology

Tunisia's geography creates natural corridors essential for wildlife movement and climate change adaptation. The Dorsale mountains form north-south montane corridors, while seasonal streams (wadis) link mountains to plains. However, human infrastructure is increasingly fragmenting these landscapes. Forest patch size has decreased by 60% since 1960, and 84% of wetlands have been lost or degraded, disrupting crucial waterbird networks.
